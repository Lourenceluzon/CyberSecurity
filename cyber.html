Cybersecurity is the protection to defend internet-connected <br>devices and services from malicious attacksby hackers, spammers, <br>and cybercriminals. The practice is used by companies to protect<br> against phishing schemes, ransomware attacks, identity theft,<br> data breaches, and financial losses.

 <p class="im">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look around today's world, and you'll see that daily life is more dependent on technology than ever before. The benefits of this trend range from near-instant access to information on the Internet to the modern conveniences provided by smart home automation technology and concepts like the Internet of Things.

With so much good coming from technology, it can be hard to believe that potential threats lurk behind every device and platform. Yet, despite society's rosy perception of modern advances, cyber security threats presented by modern tech are a real danger.

A steady rise in cybercrime highlights the flaws in devices and services we've come to depend on. This concern forces us to ask what cyber security is, why it's essential, and what to learn about it.
