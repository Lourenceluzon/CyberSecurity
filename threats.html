 	 	<br><br>
 	 	  <h1 class="my">MALWARE</h1>
 	 	<img src="gallery/mal.jpg" class="img">	
 	  	<p class="paragg">•	Malware is the collective name for several malicious software variants, including viruses, ransomware, and spyware? Shorthand for malicious software, malware typically consists of code developed by cyberattacks, designed to cause extensive damage to data and systems or to gain unauthorized access to a network. 
 	  		<br>
 	  		<br>
•	Malware is typically delivered in the form of a link or file over email and requires the user to click on the link or open the file to execute the malware. 
<br>
<br>
•	Malware has been a threat to individuals and organizations since the early 1970s when the Creeper virus first appeared. Since then, the world has been under attack from hundreds of thousands of different malware variants, all with the intent of causing the most disruption and damage as possible. 
<br>
<br>
•	Malware delivers its payload in several different ways. From demanding a ransom to stealing sensitive personal data, cybercriminals are becoming more and more sophisticated in their methods. The following is a list of some of the more common malware types and definitions.
</p>
 	  	<br><br><br><br>
 	  <h1 class="my">PHISHING</h1>
 		<img src="gallery/phis.jpg" class="img">
 	 	<p class="paragg">•	Phishing is a cybercrime that leverages deceptive emails, websites, and text messages to steal confidential personal and corporate information. Victims are tricked into giving up personal information such as their credit card data, phone number, mailing address, company information, etc. This information is then used by criminals to steal the victim’s identity and commit further crimes using this stolen identity. Criminals who use phishing tactics are successful because they carefully hide behind emails and websites familiar to the intended victim. <br>
<br>
 	 	For example, the email address might be administrator@paypal.org.com instead of administrator@paypal.com and urge the recipient to update their account credentials to protect them from fraud. Phishing is a type of social engineering that criminals use to steal data, infect computers, and infiltrate company networks.</p>
	<br><br><br><br>
	<h1 class="my">TROJANS</h1>
		<img src="gallery/tro.png" class="img">
 	 	<p class="paragg">•	Trojans are deceptive programs that appear to perform one function, but in fact perform another, malicious function. They might be disguised as free software, videos or music, or seemingly legitimate advertisements. The term “trojan virus” is not technically accurate; according to most definitions, trojans are not viruses. A virus is a program that spreads by attaching itself to other software, while a trojan spreads by pretending to be useful software or content. Many experts consider spyware programs, which track user activity and send logs or data back to the attacker, as a type of trojan.<br>
 	 		<br>
•	 Trojans can act as standalone tools for attackers or can be a platform for other malicious activity. For example, trojan downloaders are used by attackers to deliver future payloads to a victim’s device. Trojan rootkits can be used to establish a persistent presence on a user’s device or a corporate network.
</p>
	<br><br><br><br>
	<h1 class="my">RANSOMWARE</h1>
		<img src="gallery/ram.jpg" class="img">
 	 	<p class="paragg">•	Ransomware is a subset of malware in which the data on a victim's computer is locked -- typically by encryption -- and payment is demanded before the ransomed data is decrypted and access is returned to the victim. The motive for ransomware attacks is usually monetary, and unlike other types of attacks, the victim is usually notified that an exploit has occurred and is given instructions for how to recover from the attack. Payment is often demanded in a virtual currency, such as bitcoin, so that the cybercriminal's identity is not known. <br>
 	 		<br>
•	Ransomware malware can be spread through malicious attachments found in emails or in infected malicious software apps, infected external storage devices and compromised websites. Attacks have also used Remote Desktop Protocol and other approaches that do not rely on any form of user interaction.<br>
<br>
•	 Ransomware kits on the deep web have enabled cybercriminals to purchase and use software tools to create ransomware with specific capabilities. They can then generate this malware for their own distribution, with ransoms paid to their bitcoin accounts. As with much of the rest of the information technology world, it is now possible for those with little or no technical background to order inexpensive ransomware as a service (RaaS) and launch attacks with minimal effort. One of the more common methods of delivering ransomware attacks is through a phishing email. An attachment the victim thinks they can trust is added to an email as a link. <br>
<br>
•	Once the victim clicks on that link, the malware in the file begins to download. Other more aggressive forms of ransomware will exploit security holes to infect a system, so they do not have to rely on tricking users. The malware can also be spread through chat messages, removable Universal Serial Bus (USB) drives or browser plugins. Once the malware is in a system, it will begin encrypting the victim's data. It will then add an extension to the files, making them inaccessible. Once this is done, the files cannot be decrypted without a key known only by the attacker. The ransomware will then display a message to the victim, explaining that files are inaccessible and can only be accessed again upon paying a ransom to the attackers -- commonly in the form of bitcoin.
</p>

<h1 class="my">DATA BREACH</h1>
		<img src="gallery/data.jpg" class="img">
 	 	<p class="paragg">•	A data breach is the release of confidential, private, or otherwise sensitive information into an unsecured environment. A data breach can occur accidentally, or as the result of a deliberate attack. Millions of people are affected by data breaches every year, and they can range in scope from a doctor accidentally looking at the wrong patient’s chart, to a large-scale attempt to access government computers to uncover sensitive information.<br>
 	 		<br>
•	 Data breaches are a major security concern because sensitive data is constantly being transmitted over the Internet. This continuous transfer of information makes it possible for attackers in any location to attempt data breaches on almost any person or business they choose. Data is also stored in digital form by businesses all over the world. The servers that store the data are often vulnerable to various forms of cyber-attack.
